# Long-Running Init Agent Configuration
# Specialized agent for initializing long-running coding sessions
# Key differences from longrun_coding_agent:
# - May use different LLM (e.g., cheaper model for planning)
# - May have different tools (e.g., more exploratory, less execution)
# - Uses "longrun_init" specialist prompt focused on project analysis

profile: longrun_init_agent
specialist: longrun_init  # Uses LONGRUN_INIT_SPECIALIST_PROMPT (project analysis)

# Persistence configuration
persistence:
  type: file
  work_dir: .taskforce_longrun

# Agent configuration
agent:
  enable_fast_path: false  # Disable fast-path for thorough analysis
  max_steps: 30  # Init typically needs fewer steps than coding
  planning_strategy: native_react

# LLM configuration
llm:
  config_path: configs/llm_config.yaml
  provider_type: zai  # Can be changed to cheaper provider for init
  default_model: main

# Logging configuration
logging:
  level: DEBUG
  format: console

# Context Policy configuration
context_policy:
  max_items: 15
  max_chars_per_item: 800
  max_total_chars: 5000
  include_latest_tool_previews_n: 8
  allow_tools: null
  allow_selectors:
    - first_chars

# Tool configuration for init agent
# Focus on exploration and setup, less on execution
# CRITICAL: NO ask_user tool - agent must work autonomously
tools:
  - file_read
  - file_write
  - powershell
  # python is excluded - init phase focuses on analysis, not code execution
  # ask_user is intentionally EXCLUDED for autonomous operation
