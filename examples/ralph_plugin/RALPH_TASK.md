# Ralph Task: Simple Calculator Application

## Task Description

Create a simple calculator application with the following requirements:

### Core Functionality

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handle division by zero gracefully
   - Validate input types
   - Provide clear error messages

3. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Accept numbers and operations as arguments
   - Display results clearly
   - Support interactive mode (optional)

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all arithmetic operations
   - Tests for error cases (division by zero, invalid input)
   - Tests should use pytest framework

### Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Code Quality**: Follow PEP 8, include type hints
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all functions

### Success Criteria

- All arithmetic operations work correctly
- Division by zero is handled with appropriate error message
- All tests pass
- Code follows project coding standards
- CLI is functional and user-friendly

## Expected Output

After running the Ralph Loop, you should have:

- `calculator.py` - Main calculator module
- `test_calculator.py` - Unit tests
- `cli.py` or `main.py` - Command-line interface
- All tests passing
- Code documented with docstrings

## Notes

This is a simple example task designed to demonstrate the Ralph Loop pattern. The task is intentionally straightforward to make it easy to understand the workflow.
