Accounting Agent Example

This is a standalone example showing how to build a specialized accounting agent
using the Taskforce framework. It demonstrates:

- Custom domain models for German accounting
- Specialized tools for invoice processing
- Integration with external tools (Docling)
- Rule-based decision making
- Compliance checking (§14 UStG)

This example can serve as a template for building your own domain-specific agents.
