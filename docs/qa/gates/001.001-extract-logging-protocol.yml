nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Protocol abstraction maintains existing security posture."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance impact. Protocol adds minimal overhead, maintains existing performance characteristics."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling maintained. Factory ensures logger is always provided."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent separation of concerns. Core domain now independent of logging implementation. Protocol allows easy testing and future logging library changes."
