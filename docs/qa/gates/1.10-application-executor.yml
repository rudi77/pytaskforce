nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Session IDs generated using secure UUID v4. No secrets or sensitive data exposed. Proper error handling prevents information leakage. Factory injection pattern prevents unauthorized agent creation.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Performance requirement exceeded: Executor overhead <50ms verified by three performance tests (test_executor_overhead_under_50ms, test_executor_overhead_minimal, test_executor_streaming_overhead). All tests pass, confirming minimal overhead. Streaming implementation is efficient with async generators.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with structured logging. Exceptions properly propagated with context. Error events yielded in streaming mode. Duration tracking for observability. Proper exception types maintained (RuntimeError, etc.). Graceful degradation when callbacks not provided.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code quality: 100% test coverage (74 statements, 0 missed), comprehensive docstrings with clear examples, proper type annotations throughout, clean separation of concerns. Follows Clean Architecture with proper dependency injection. Code is well-structured, readable, and easy to extend. ProgressUpdate dataclass provides clear API contract.'
