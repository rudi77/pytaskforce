  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns - prompt optimization and tool filtering change only. No authentication/authorization changes.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Performance optimization achieved - removes unnecessary llm_generate tool calls, reduces token usage and improves latency. Can be measured via trace analysis.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Backward compatible via config flag. Graceful degradation - can opt-in to llm_generate if needed. No breaking changes.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear code structure, well-documented configuration option, easy to understand and modify.'
