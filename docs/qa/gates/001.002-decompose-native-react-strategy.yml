nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Refactoring maintains existing security posture. No new attack surfaces introduced."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance degradation observed. Function extraction adds minimal overhead. Integration tests confirm performance maintained."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Behavior preservation verified through integration tests. Error handling patterns maintained. AsyncIterator patterns correctly preserved."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent improvement. 440-line function decomposed into focused, testable units. Clear single responsibility per function. Code is significantly more maintainable."
