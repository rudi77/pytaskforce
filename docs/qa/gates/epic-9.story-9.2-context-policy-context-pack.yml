nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Policy validation prevents injection attacks. Tool allowlist provides security boundary. No sensitive data exposure.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Bounded execution time via policy caps. No blocking operations. Efficient string operations. Conservative defaults prevent token explosion.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Deterministic behavior (no randomness). Proper error handling with validation and fallbacks. Conservative defaults prevent failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear code structure and comprehensive documentation. Config-driven behavior enables easy adjustments. Comprehensive test coverage. Clean Architecture compliance.'
