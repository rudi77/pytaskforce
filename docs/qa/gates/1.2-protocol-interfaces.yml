  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Interface definitions only, no runtime code, no secrets, no external dependencies."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "N/A for interface definitions. Protocols are type-only contracts with zero runtime overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 15 tests passing, mypy type checking passes with zero errors, protocols can be imported and used in type hints without runtime errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with comprehensive docstrings, clear protocol contracts, modern Python 3.11 syntax (dict/list/tuple instead of Dict/List/Tuple), proper type annotations throughout."

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "taskforce/tests/unit/test_protocols.py"
    change: "Fixed deprecated typing imports (Dict/List/Tuple/Optional) to modern Python 3.11 syntax (dict/list/tuple/| None)"
    reason: "Comply with PEP 585 and PEP 604, eliminate deprecation warnings from Ruff"
    impact: "No functional change, improves code maintainability and aligns with Python 3.11+ best practices"
