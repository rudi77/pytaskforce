nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns - cache only stores tool execution results in memory. Whitelist approach ensures only read-only tools are cached, preventing caching of mutation operations.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Performance optimization achieved - session-scoped cache eliminates redundant tool calls, improves latency for repeated queries. Can be measured via trace analysis and cache statistics.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Cache is additive - removing it does not break functionality (can disable via config). Graceful degradation - agent works normally without cache. TTL prevents stale data issues.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear code structure and documentation. Well-documented configuration options. Cache is isolated infrastructure component following Clean Architecture principles.'
