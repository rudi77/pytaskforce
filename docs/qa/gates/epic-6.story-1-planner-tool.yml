nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Tool manages internal state only, no external I/O, no secrets, no user input validation needed (handled by LLM). State serialization is safe (dict-based)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance characteristics. All operations are O(n) where n is number of tasks. No I/O operations, pure in-memory state management. Formatting is efficient string concatenation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 46 tests passing, comprehensive error handling with clear error messages. State serialization/deserialization tested via roundtrip tests. Edge cases covered (empty state, invalid indices, missing parameters)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality. Clear action-based interface, comprehensive docstrings, well-structured methods. LLM-friendly description with examples. Follows ToolProtocol contract perfectly. 83% code coverage."
