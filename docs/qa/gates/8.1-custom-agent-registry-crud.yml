nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Input validation via Pydantic, YAML safe_load, no secrets. Path traversal risk mitigated by validation. No auth by design (MVP scope).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'File I/O lightweight, atomic writes non-blocking. List operation scans directory (acceptable scale). No performance bottlenecks.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Atomic writes prevent corruption. Corrupt YAML handled gracefully. Error handling comprehensive. Thread safety concern documented but mitigated by atomic operations.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture, comprehensive docstrings, type hints, follows existing patterns. Tests serve as documentation.'
