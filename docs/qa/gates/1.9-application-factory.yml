  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. No secrets hardcoded, proper environment variable usage for sensitive configuration (database URLs, API keys). Credentials handled securely via environment variables.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Agent construction time <200ms verified by integration test (test_agent_construction_time). Factory initialization is lightweight with efficient YAML parsing. Lazy imports prevent unnecessary overhead.'

    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with helpful error messages. Proper exception types (FileNotFoundError, ValueError). Defensive programming with safe defaults. Structured logging for observability.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code quality: 94% test coverage, comprehensive docstrings with examples, proper type annotations, clear naming conventions. Clean Architecture principles followed with proper dependency injection. Code is well-structured and easy to extend.'
