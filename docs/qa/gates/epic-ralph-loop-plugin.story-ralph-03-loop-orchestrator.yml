status_reason: "Well-implemented PowerShell orchestrator meets all functional requirements, but lacks automated tests. Code quality is good with minor improvements needed. Manual testing recommended before production use."

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No automated tests for PowerShell orchestrator script"
    suggested_action: "Consider adding Pester tests or at minimum document manual test scenarios. PowerShell scripts are harder to test than Python, but integration tests with mocked taskforce CLI would provide value."

    severity: low
    finding: "Duplicate log message removed during review (line 282)"

    suggested_owner: "dev"
  - id: "CODE-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "JSON extraction regex pattern `\\{.*\\}` is greedy and may match too much in edge cases"
    suggested_action: "Consider using non-greedy pattern `\\{.*?\\}` or more robust JSON extraction method"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Script uses standard PowerShell cmdlets, validates environment, handles errors safely. Git operations are standard and safe."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Script is lightweight, uses appropriate delays (1-2 seconds) between iterations. No performance bottlenecks identified."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good error handling and resilience patterns, but lack of automated tests makes regression detection difficult. Script handles malformed JSON and non-zero exit codes appropriately."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured with clear functions, good logging, configurable parameters at top. Code is readable and follows PowerShell best practices. Functions are appropriately sized."
