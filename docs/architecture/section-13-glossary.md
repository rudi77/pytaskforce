# Section 13: Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout this architecture:

---

### **Core Concepts**

**Agent**:
The core orchestrator implementing the ReAct (Reason + Act) execution loop. Coordinates LLM calls, tool execution, and state management to accomplish missions.

**Mission**:
A user-provided task description in natural language that the agent attempts to accomplish (e.g., "Create a Python web scraper").

**ReAct Loop**:
A reasoning pattern where the agent iteratively: (1) generates a **Thought** (reasoning), (2) decides an **Action** (tool call or decision), (3) observes the **Observation** (result), then repeats until mission complete.

**Session**:
A single execution instance with a unique ID, representing one mission execution from start to completion or failure.

**State**:
The persisted snapshot of a session at a point in time, including mission text, current status, answers, TodoList ID, and execution history.

**TodoList**:
A structured plan generated by the agent that breaks a mission into sequential tasks (TodoItems) with dependencies and acceptance criteria.

**TodoItem**:
A single actionable task within a TodoList, with a description, acceptance criteria, dependencies on other tasks, and execution status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed, skipped).

**Tool**:
An executable capability provided to the agent (e.g., PythonTool, FileReadTool, WebSearchTool). Tools implement the `ToolProtocol` interface with `execute()` method.

### **Architecture Patterns**

**Clean Architecture**:
A software architectural pattern emphasizing separation of concerns into concentric layers: Core (business logic), Infrastructure (adapters), Application (use cases), API (entrypoints). Dependencies point inward; outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse.

**Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**:
Alternative name for Clean Architecture. The "core" is the hexagon, "ports" are interfaces defining contracts, "adapters" are concrete implementations of ports.

**Protocol (Port)**:
In Python, a `typing.Protocol` defining a contract (interface) that concrete classes must implement. Used to define layer boundaries (e.g., `StateManagerProtocol`, `ToolProtocol`).

**Adapter**:
A concrete implementation of a Protocol. Example: `FileStateManager` and `DbStateManager` both implement `StateManagerProtocol`, allowing runtime swapping.

**Dependency Injection (DI)**:
A design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class rather than the class creating them. In Taskforce, the `AgentFactory` creates all dependencies and injects them into the `Agent`.

**Repository Pattern**:
An abstraction for data access that encapsulates the logic required to access data sources. `StateManager` acts as a repository for session state.

### **Domain Events**

**Thought**:
Immutable domain event representing the agent's reasoning step. Contains LLM-generated rationale for the next action.

**Action**:
Immutable domain event representing the agent's decision. Types: `tool_call`, `ask_user`, `complete`, `replan`.

**Observation**:
Immutable domain event representing the result of an action. Contains success status, output data, and any errors.

### **LLM Terms**

**Token**:

**Temperature**:
LLM parameter controlling randomness in responses (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative). Default: 0.7.

**Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**:
